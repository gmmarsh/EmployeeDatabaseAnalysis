# Employee Database Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation and querying of a relational database to manage employee data, including departments, titles, salaries, and managerial roles. The database schema is designed to support various analytical queries, such as retrieving employee details, department assignments, and salary information. The SQL scripts provided include table creation statements and a set of analytical queries to extract meaningful insights from the employee data.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was generated by Mockaroo, LLC (2022), a realistic data generator tool. Source: [Mockaroo, LLC](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Setup**:
   - Use a SQL database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
   - Execute the table creation script (`create_tables.sql`) to set up the database schema.
   - Ensure tables are created in the correct order to satisfy foreign key constraints: `department`, `titles`, `employees`, `dept_emp`, `dept_manager`, `salaries`.

2. **Data Population**:
   - Populate the tables with data generated by Mockaroo or equivalent synthetic data matching the schema.
   - Verify data integrity, ensuring foreign key constraints are met (e.g., `emp_title_id` in `employees` references `title_id` in `titles`).

3. **Query Execution**:
   - Run the query script (`employee_queries.sql`) to perform the analytical queries.
   - Ensure the database is populated before executing queries to avoid empty results.

## File Descriptions
- **`create_tables.sql`**:
  - Contains SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements to define the database schema.
  - Tables include:
    - `department`: Stores department numbers and names.
    - `titles`: Stores job title IDs and names.
    - `employees`: Stores employee details (employee number, title, birth date, name, sex, hire date).
    - `dept_emp`: Maps employees to departments (many-to-many relationship).
    - `dept_manager`: Identifies department managers.
    - `salaries`: Stores employee salary information.
  - Includes primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

- **`employee_queries.sql`**:
  - Contains eight SQL queries for analyzing the employee database:
    1. Lists employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
    2. Lists first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
    3. Lists department managers with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
    4. Lists department number, employee number, last name, first name, and department name for each employee.
    5. Lists first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names starting with 'B'.
    6. Lists employee number, last name, and first name for employees in the Sales department.
    7. Lists employee number, last name, first name, and department name for employees in the Sales and Development departments.
    8. Lists frequency counts of employee last names in descending order.

## Usage
1. **Create the Database**:
   - Run `create_tables.sql` in your SQL environment to create the tables.
   - Example (PostgreSQL):
     ```bash
     psql -U username -d database_name -f create_tables.sql
     ```

2. **Populate the Data**:
   - Import or insert the Mockaroo-generated data into the tables.
   - Ensure data types and constraints are respected (e.g., `DATE` for `birth_date`, `INT` for `emp_no`).

3. **Run Queries**:
   - Execute `employee_queries.sql` to retrieve the analytical results.
   - Example (PostgreSQL):
     ```bash
     psql -U username -d database_name -f employee_queries.sql
     ```

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - Review query outputs to gain insights into employee demographics, department assignments, and salary distributions.

## Notes
- **Assumptions**:
  - The `dept_no` values 'd007' (Sales) and 'd004' (Development) are hardcoded in queries based on assumed department identifiers from the Mockaroo data.
  - The salary table uses a composite primary key (`emp_no`, `salary`), assuming multiple salary records per employee are possible (e.g., historical salaries).
  - The data is synthetic and may not reflect real-world complexities (e.g., missing edge cases like null values).

- **Limitations**:
  - Queries assume all tables are populated with valid data. Empty or incomplete tables will yield no results.
  - The schema does not account for historical data (e.g., end dates for department assignments or salary changes).
  - Queries are designed for specific use cases and may need modification for broader analysis.

- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `emp_no`, `dept_no`) to improve performance.
  - Include date ranges for `dept_emp` and `dept_manager` to track historical assignments.
  - Expand queries to handle edge cases, such as employees without department assignments.
